### BIOL 7180 Project Proposal:
# MicroPower

### Background:

- Microbiome analyses give insight into composition and function of bacterial communities in a particular location
- Power analysis and sample sizes calculation, ideally based on pilot runs, are fundamental for designing a study protocol
- Microbiome power analysis and sample size calculations are complex and time consuming

### Objective:

-
