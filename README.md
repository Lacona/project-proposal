### BIOL 7180 Project Proposal:
# 16PS - power for 16SrRNA microbiome studies!

## Background:

- Microbiome analyses give insight into composition and function of bacterial communities in a particular location
- Microbiome studies often compare a control group to groups with different environmental exposure or different treatments
- Sequencing of 16SrRNA gene is often used for microbiome analyses
- Power analysis and sample sizes calculation, ideally based on pilot runs, are fundamental for designing a study protocol
- Microbiome power analysis and sample size calculations are complex and time consuming

## Questions:

- How many reads do I need to sequence?
- How many samples I need to detect the expected effect?

## Objective:

- Predictive power analysis and sample size results
- Intuitive user interface
- Logically structured data visualization

## Tasks:

- Find the best calculation method (PERMANOVA, Dirichlet multinomial model, t-test, chi-square test)
- Determine all the parameters relevant for the calculations
- Script the code in Python3
- Design an intuitive user interface 

## Result:

**16PS** will simplify and optimize power analysis and sample size calculations for 16SrRNA microbiome studies
